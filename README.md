# Amazon Clone

This project is a simple front-end clone of the Amazon website. I built it using HTML and CSS as a way to practice designing real-world web pages. The main focus was on understanding layout, styling, and how to organize code for a bigger project.

## Features
- Navigation bar with logo, location, search box, account, orders, and cart
- Hero section with a banner image
- Product category boxes like Clothes, Electronics, Furniture, etc.
- Footer designed similar to Amazon with multiple panels and links
- Hover effects for better user experience

## What I Learned
- Using Flexbox to arrange elements in rows and columns
- Adding hover effects and borders for styling
- Creating reusable CSS classes for consistency
- Structuring a large HTML page in a clean way

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 for the structure
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- Font Awesome for icons (cart, search, etc.)
